Hello and welcome to SPACE_GANK:

This is a two player game that requires  quick thinking and deliberate movement. It is even better when there is a feud between you and the person you are playing against. 

Abstract:
Rather than a coop game, this is a game where the two players are pitted against each other. There is a hunter and a hunted player in which the hunter tries to catch
the hunted. The goal of the hunted is to survive for as long as possible without being caught. Each player has advantages and disadvantages. The hunted moves quicker and with
more precise movement via the mouse. This gives a highly responsive movement that can be adjusted consistantly. The hunter moves slower and less precisely for they use the 
aswd keys to move. However, the hunter has help with npcs that spawn randomly on the right side that will hurt the hunted if they make contact. The hunter has to use strategy
to try and corner the hunted into losing the 3 lives provided.
